#With the server language of your choice, create an authentication API that does the following.
1. Takes a login and password
2. Checks against a list (either in a database, or saved in a text file) whether than login and
password is valid
3. The passwords in the list cannot be readable for a person. Any form of basic encryption
is acceptable
4. Before checking if the username is within the database, the API will check if the log in
begins with the 2 letter country code of the login location. For example, if the login
comes from Singapore, a user name like sggalvin will be acceptable,
5. A different response should be returned for a username that does not meet the 2 letter
country code criteria#

logincode = {'username password and location':223,'username password no location':113,'username':111 }

while True:
    
    request = int(input("what is your logincode? "))
    
    if request == 223:
        print ("welcome!")
    
    elif request == 113:
        print('password and location missing')
        
    else:
        print('hmm...something is missing.')
